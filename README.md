# NKSSlidingUpPanel

NKSSlidingUpPanel is an Xamarin iOS library that allows to use 'Google Maps' or 'Google Play Music' like sliding-up panel in your applications. A little bit modified from [ARSlidingPanel](https://github.com/andriirogulin/ARSlidingPanel) to use panel view with UIScrollView, but all principles are still the same.

All API the same with ARSlidingPanel.

Thanks [andriirogulin] (https://github.com/andriirogulin) for his work.

# Enjoy
