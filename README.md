# NKSSlidingUpPanel

NKSSlidingUpPanel is an Xamarin iOS Sliding Up Panel library that allows to use 'Google Maps' or 'Google Play Music' like Android Slidin Up Panel control in your applications. A little bit modified from [ARSlidingPanel](https://github.com/andriirogulin/ARSlidingPanel) to use panel view with UIScrollView, but all principles are still the same.

All API the same with ARSlidingPanel.

For Mvvmcross added MvxNKSSlidingUpControllerWithController ( Yes, I know, then name is awful :) )

There you can use UIViewControllers/MvxViewControllers for MainViewController and PanelViewController presentation. 
Just add MvxTableViewController/UITableViewController to PanelViewController and magic will happen.

Thanks [andriirogulin] (https://github.com/andriirogulin) for his work.

# Enjoy
